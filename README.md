# simple-notes
A Vanilla JS simple notes app using IndexedDB :sparkles:

### Installing

Unfortunately, it's not deployed anywhere so please take a look at it locally.
You can use `http-server` to easily run a server locally.

Install the module using npm:
```
$ npm install http-server -g
```

then, go inside the cloned repository
```
$ cd /path/to/this/repo
```

finally, simply do:
```
$ http-server
```
This will launch the server.
You can go onto http://localhost:8080 to see the app, yay!
